## Summary
We minimize the **total net cost** (maintenance + purchase − trade-in) for a mixed shuttle fleet over a 5-year horizon. The problem is modeled as a **network (shortest-path) MILP** with budget constraints and solved via **Excel Solver**, **Gurobi**, and **AMPL**. We provide optimal replacement paths per bus type and sensitivity analyses.
